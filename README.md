This is a Treasure Game - A map will be shown to you with buried treasure 
	 you have to find the treasure with clicking on it.
	 on every unsuccessful click, a message will be shown to you with how much closer you are.
	 on successful click - Game will be finished.

   I created this game along with my friends as a final project for our coding class. 
   It has two levels Easy and Hard. We added background music, a talking parrot and a stats feature at the end to show your current stats and your best stats! 
   The stats that are given are the number of clicks and the time it takes.
